# twitter-etl
Used Twitter API to  extract/fetch tweet data by IIT Kanpur and used python to transform data, loaded that data into a Pandas dataframe and deploy the code on Airflow on Azure VMand save the final result on Amazon S3. I also visualised the data transformed into Pandas dataframe in Jupyter Notebook.
